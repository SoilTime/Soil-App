# Soil-App

## Find the soil type of a certain city, and populate plants that would be able to grow in that area.

## About the project.

This project was developed to help plant lovers/farmers get all the information they need to plant in their city.
The app requires user to enter city name and the user will be supplied with the soil type in that city and the type of plants suitable for the soil.

This app can be used on different scales, ranging from a small garden to a big farm.

## The design

Express-handlebars was used in the main frontend design to avoid repetition of codes needed on multiple pages and we used CSS grid system to set the layout of what the general outlook should be.

We added some styling to the page using basic CSS properties and also added some animations to with Google Sketch and SVG Animations. We also used media queries to ensure the app is responsive and ensure user satisfaction when viewing on different devices.

## Third party APIs and Database

We used Google API to display the map on the page and also use the location to query the database. The database would return the type of soil in location that user enters and also the plant(s) suitable for that type if soil. We then use the plant from the database to query the Wikipedia API to get more information like the picture of the plant and a brief summary of what the plant can be used for.
